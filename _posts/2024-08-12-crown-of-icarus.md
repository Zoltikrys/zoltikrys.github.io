I recently participated in the GDG Skills Bootcamp, and it was an incredible learning experience that deepened my understanding of the industry and the development cycle. Over the course of sixteen weeks, I had the privilege of attending lectures and insightful talks, including sessions with industry experts who shared their valuable experiences. The bootcamp also provided me with the opportunity to collaborate with a team on developing a game called Crown of Icarus, which proved to be an incredible learning experience. Throughout the development process, we faced a few setbacks, resulting in a finished prototype rather than a complete game. While this was somewhat disappointing, our team is committed to continuing development, and with the strong foundation we've built, I’m hopeful that we’ll be able to bring the game to completion.
