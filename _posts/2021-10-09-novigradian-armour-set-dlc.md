## An armour set loosely based on the description in the books 

Ever notice how each region in TW3 got their own armour DLC except Novigrad? (ok well it's not exactly a region but considering how much of the game takes place in Novigrad alone it may as well be)

Well worry no longer - this set aims to fill that void!

I based this set loosely on the description of Geralt's armour in the books but I also wanted it to feel like something Geralt would wear instead of it being a 1:1 copy (hence the pants being based on the viper/KM pants etc)

All of the items can be bought from Hattori's store in Novigrad

If you like this armour design but would prefer the stats of the witcher armour sets, consider checking [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/6404)﻿ mod out and using the optional files :)

Huge thanks to everyone in the Wolven Workshop discord for all their help and most notably to [Bjorn](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Bjorn18/about-me?gameId=952) as I couldn't have done nearly as well as I did without his input and feedback.

Thanks to [LordMazour](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/LordMazour/about-me) for creating the Czech translation.
