Hi, I'm Chris, a Computer Hardware and Software Engineering graduate from Coventry University. Throughout my studies, I focused on software and robotic, and my final year project involved writing the code for a robot arm. I have experience using C++, C# and Python as well as Unreal Engine. In addition to this, I'm currently exploring the Godot Engine and what I can do with that. I'm passionate about using my skills in to contribute to projects and I'm always eager to develop my skills and learn new things. Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing and model kits!
